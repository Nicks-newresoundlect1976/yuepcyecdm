Oh man, where do I even begin? Just stumbled out of the theater, and my head’s spinning like a top – or, like, a toddler hopped up on sugary cereal. “Where There Is Love, There Is No Darkness” – honestly, the title feels like a hopeful hug... even though my back's a bit sore from those weirdly angled seats (like, what is even up with those, right?).

The movie just kinda... sinks into you. Like, picture this: halfway through, I think I ate more popcorn than anticipated. And then when that scene came up – the one in the rain, with the lights reflecting like a kaleidoscope on steroids – I was gripping my empty popcorn bag like it was the holy grail. It was so freaking beautiful, and suddenly I just felt so… tiny.

> Folks behind me wouldn't quit whispering, like an endless cricket symphony, but then again, does it really matter? Her umbrella helped blot out every disagreement, every noise. As if the color red had opinions of its own. Does that make sense? Prolly not. Yet it does.

The dude next to me kept shuffling too, made me realize my shoes are squeaky clean – never had theater shoes before, I guess? Anyway, the characters seemed to walk on parallel lines they didn’t even know existed, dancing between shadows. It’s like falling into a deep pool of emotions where you don’t know if you’re gonna drown or float. Please tell me someone else felt that too?

Oh, crap, nearly forgot! You asked if it’s worth the time to download the movie – hell yeah. You gotta watch the movie. Just be ready to feel... everything.

Weird analogy time: it was like drinking hot cocoa with chili in it. Unexpected warmth with an end-kick that leaves you pondering sucking the air in through your teeth. Not sure how I’m getting home – mind's all over the place like pieces of eggshell in a sunny-side-up.

just found some popcorn crumbs in my pocket, i think its from last time...?? oh boy.
